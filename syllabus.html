        <p><strong>Midterm&nbsp;Exam</strong></p>
        <p>This will be a closed book exam. This is used to evaluate your recall and understanding of course material, as well as your ability to apply it to new situations.</p>
        <p><strong>Weekly Assignments</strong></p>
        <p>Most weeks you will have some form of assignment, typically writing HTML and/or CSS.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Each assignment will be weighted differently.</li>
        <li>All weekly assignments are due by Saturday 11:59PM of the week they are assigned.</li>
        <li>Assignments should be submitted via Blackboard.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Class Contribution</strong></p>
        <p>These 10 points are there to motivate you to do more than just code. To maximize this part of your course grade:
            <ul>
                <li>Attend class<br />
                    You can't contribute if you aren't present, so attendance at every class session is expected, including open lab time for project work. Policy for absences:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pre-arrange any anticipated absence with the instructor, ideally at least 2 weeks before. This includes athletic team participation and religious observance, per university policy, but also any future medical situations that you know about ahead of time.</li>
                        <li>Unanticipated medical situations or other causes: Email preferably 24 hours before class but as soon as you determine you won't attend.</li>
                        <li>Up to two absences during the semester are excusable. More will require documentation from a health care provider. After that, class contribution points will be deducted.</li>
                        <li>Absent students are responsible for reviewing class readings and slides, and they will need to obtain notes from fellow students who were in attendance.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Ask questions in class</li>
                <li>Respond to others' questions</li>
                <li>Speak up in class to share insightful thoughts and your own perspectives</li>
                <li>Attend office hours</li>
            </ul>
        <p><strong>Individual Project</strong></p>
        <p>This project will be due after week 14 and will be a culmination of everything learned from weeks 1&ndash;13. You will be required to work on parts of it each week starting week 2.</p>

        <p><strong>Blackboard</strong></p>
        <p>Syracuse University’s Blackboard system will be used for announcements as well as posting and submitting assignment deliverables. You can access it at: <a href="http://blackboard.syr.edu">blackboard.syr.edu</a> where you will log in with your SU NetID and password.</p>
        <p>To search for answers to your Blackboard questions, visit the <a href="https://answers.syr.edu/display/blackboard01/Blackboard">Answers self-help knowledge</a> web page.  If you have problems logging in or need assistance with Blackboard, contact the ITS Service Center at: <a href="mailto:help@syr.edu">help@syr.edu</a> or 315.443.2677.  The Syracuse University Blackboard support team will assist you.</p> 
        <p><strong>Late Work</strong></p>
        <p>Blackboard submission timestamps all submitted work. Any work submitted late will be evaluated but points will be deducted:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Up to 24 hours late: 5% deduction</li>
                <li>More than 24 but less than 48 hours late: additional 15% deduction</li>
                <li>More than 48 hours late: no points will be awarded</li>
            </ul>
        <p>If a student anticipates difficulty meeting an assignment deadline for some known reason (e.g., expected medical leave, necessary travel, etc.), arrangements can be made to shift that deadline, but <strong>only</strong> if the student contacts the instructor via email at least <strong>24 hours before the deadline</strong>. Some flexibility is possible, especially for unexpected medical situations. Please email as soon as you recognize a risk of late submission &mdash; again, <strong>before</strong> the deadline &mdash; and we will try to work out an adjustment.</p>
            
        <p><strong>Technology Requirements</strong></p>
        <p>Each of the following technology requirements are mandatory. You must set them up following posted instructions, as their use is essential to your grade in the course.</p>
        <p><strong>Bring Your Own Device</strong> &mdash; This course uses the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) model. The expectations are that you own a notebook computer and you will bring it to every class fully charged. If you don’t own a notebook computer you can borrow one from the iSchool using your SUID. You will be expected to install software on your notebook computer. Instructions will be provided.</p>
        <p><strong>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</strong></p>
        <p>This course will require the use of an IDE. Visit the <a href="../about/computer-setup.html">instructions and setup page</a> to learn more.</p>
        <p><strong>A Strategy for Success</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Complete the assigned reading for the week before the week begins.</li>
        <li>Master the objectives as you work your way through the reading.</li>
        <li>Identify and note what you don’t understand.</li>
        <li>Attend class.</li>
        <li>As we go through the material, if you still don’t understand something…ASK A QUESTION!</li>
        <li>Take efficient notes.</li>
        <li>Do not copy the slides into your notes. They will be made available to you.</li>
        <li>Remember key points and <u>why</u> these points are key. If the instructor says something is or is not "best practice" that is a signal that a key point has just been made.</li>
        <li>Recognize the thread that weaves these points together.</li>
        <li>If you still don’t get something GET HELP. Attend office hours.</li>
        <li>Practice the assignments.</li>
        <li>Submit assignments ahead of the deadlines. You don't want some Blackboard glitch to cost you points for late submission.</li>
        <li>Double-check your Blackboard submission to confirm that everything you think you submitted is present.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>University Attendance Policy</strong></p>
        <p>All instruction for IST263 during fall 2020 will be presented via the Zoom remote meeting technology. Office hours and any ad hoc working sessions with the instructor will also use Zoom.</p>
        <p>Attendance in classes is expected in all courses, in-person or remote, at Syracuse University. Students are expected to arrive on campus in time to attend the first meeting of all classes for which they are registered.  Students who do not attend classes starting with the first scheduled meeting may be academically withdrawn as not making progress toward degree by failure to attend. Instructors set course-specific policies for absences from scheduled class meetings in their syllabi.</p>
        <p>It is a federal requirement that students who do not attend or cease to attend a class to be reported at the time of determination by the faculty. Faculty should use “ESPR” and “MSPR” in Orange Success to alert the Office of the Registrar and the Office of Financial Aid. A grade of NA is posted to any student for whom the Never Attended flag is raised in Orange SUccess. More information regarding Orange SUccess can be found here, at the <a href="http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/">Orange SUccess site</a> itself.</p>
        <p>Students should also review the University’s religious observance policy and make the required arrangements at the beginning of each semester.</p>
        <a name="su-policies"></a><h3>Syracuse University Policies</h3>
        <p>Syracuse University has a variety of other policies designed to guarantee that students live and study in a community respectful of their needs and those of fellow students. Some of the most important of these concerns:</p>
        <p>Diversity and Disability (ensuring that students are aware of their rights and responsibilities in a diverse, inclusive, accessible, bias-free campus community) can be found on the <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/life/accessibilitydiversity/">Accessability page</a> of the SU website.</p>
        <p>Religious Observances Notification and Policy (steps to follow to request accommodations for the observance of religious holidays) can be found on the <a href="http://supolicies.syr.edu/studs/religious_observance.htm">Religious Observances page</a> of the SU Website.</p>
        <p>Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I invite any student to meet with me to discuss strategies and/or accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your success and to collaborate with the Center for Disability Resources (CDR)(formerly named the Office of Disability Services) in this process.</p>
        <p>If you would like to discuss disability accommodations or register with ODS, please visit <a href="http://disabilityservices.syr.edu">their website</a>. You can also call (315) 443-4498 or email <a href="mailto:disabilityservices@syr.edu">disabilityservices@syr.edu</a> for more detailed information.</p>
        <p>CDR is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access plan. Since academic accommodations may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact CDR as soon as possible to begin this process.</p>
        <p><strong>Academic Integrity Policy</strong></p>
        <p>Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy reflects the high value that we, as a university community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy defines our expectations for academic honesty and holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. Students should understand that it is their responsibility to learn about course-specific expectations, as well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The policy governs appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of participation in class activities. The policy also prohibits students from submitting the same work in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance from both instructors. Under the policy, students found in violation are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered as described in the Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric. Syracuse University students are required to read an online summary of the University’s academic integrity expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during pre-term check- in on MySlice.</p>
        <p>The Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric establishes recommended guidelines for the determination of grade penalties by faculty and instructors, while also giving them discretion to select the grade penalty they believe most suitable, including course failure, regardless of violation level. Any established violation in this course may result in course failure regardless of violation level.</p>
        <p>All academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person exams and assignments also apply to online equivalents. In this course, all work submitted for exams or assignments must be yours alone. Discussing exam questions with anyone during the quiz or exam period violates academic integrity expectations for this course.</p>
        <p>Using websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g. Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others and present the work as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course.</p>
        <p><strong>Discrimination or Harassment</strong></p>
        <p>The University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or discrimination related to any protected category including creed, ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex, gender, pregnancy, disability, marital status, age, race, color, veteran status, military status, religion, sexual orientation, domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression, or perceived gender.</p>
        <p>Any complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these protected bases should be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the University’s Chief Equal Opportunity & Title IX Officer. She is responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under various laws including Titles VI, VII, IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. She can be contacted at Equal Opportunity, Inclusion, and Resolution Services, 005 Steele Hall, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY 13244-1120; by email: <a href="mailto:titleix@syr.edu">titleix@syr.eddu</a>; or by telephone: 315-443-0211.</p>
        <p>Federal and state law, and University policy prohibit discrimination and harassment based on sex or gender (including sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic/dating violence, stalking, sexual exploitation, and retaliation).</p>
        <p>If a student has been harassed or assaulted, they can obtain confidential counseling support, 24-hours a day, 7 days a week, from the Sexual and Relationship Violence Response Team at the Counseling Center (315-443-4715, 200 Walnut Place, Syracuse, New York 13244-5040). Incidents of sexual violence or harassment can be reported non-confidentially to the University’s Title IX Officer (Sheila Johnson Willis, 315-443-0211, <a href="mailto:titleix@syr.edu">titleix@syr.edu</a>, 005 Steele Hall). Reports to law enforcement can be made to the University’s Department of Public Safety (315-443-2224, 005 Sims Hall), the Syracuse Police Department (511 South State Street, Syracuse, New York, 911 in case of emergency or 315-435-3016 to speak with the Abused Persons Unit), or the State Police (844-845-7269).</p>
        <p>I will seek to keep information you share with me private to the greatest extent possible, but as a professor I have mandatory reporting responsibilities to share information regarding sexual misconduct, harassment, and crimes I learn about to help make our campus a safer place for all.</p>
        <p><strong>Use of Class Materials and Recordings</strong></p>
        <p>Original class materials (handouts, assignments, tests, etc.) and recordings of class sessions are the intellectual property of the course instructor. You may download these materials for your use in this class. However, you may not provide these materials to other parties (e.g., web sites, social media, other students) without permission. Doing so is a violation of intellectual property law and of the student code of conduct.</p>
        <p><strong>Course evaluations</strong></p>
        <p>I will ask your to complete an end-of-course evaluation this term. This evaluation will be conducted online and is entirely anonymous. You will receive an official notification in your email account with the evaluation website link and your passcode. Please take the time and fill out this evaluation as your feedback and support of this assessment effort is very much appreciated.  The school carefully reviews ratings and comments that you submit, and these factor into decisions about course, program, and instructor development.</p>
